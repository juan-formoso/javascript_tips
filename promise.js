// WHAT IS A 'PROMISE' IN JAVASCRIPT?

// In simple words, a promise is an object that may produce and store a future result for an asynchronous operation.
// A promise may produce either a resolved value, or a reason why it's not resolved (e.g., a network error ocurred)

// A Promise is in one of these states:
// pending: initial state, neither fullfiled nor rejected.
// fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
// rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
// A pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value or rejected with a reason (error).
